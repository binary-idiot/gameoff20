# gameoff20
Repo for my submission to githubs [game off 2020](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2020)

Theme: **Moonshot**  
Idea: A roguelite where you explore procedually generated derilict ships and repair them to take a 'moonshot' around the moon and return to earth to be salvaged.
Equipment can be upgraded by salvaging supplies from the ship but these upgrades are lost if you die, you can also buy permanent upgrades with money from each job.
Each ship has enemies to survive while completing objectives.  

Made with Gamemaker Studio 2.3
